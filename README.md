# iShopper_intention

### About Project:
This project involves predicting something that is somewhat of a “holy grail” of business intelligence: trying to predict whether or not a customer will eventually make a purchase using while using an online shopping portal, based on the pattern of pages they have visited on the website, certain analytical features, the time of week and year, and other features.

### Data: 
The data file provided with this project is a selection of a much larger data set: it consists of 3816 data examples and 17 features; the output variable is the last (18th) column of the file labelled “Revenue” and represents whether or not a customer eventually made a purchase (0 – purchase made / 1 – purchase not made).

These features are based off the information on this webpage:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset

### Deliverables:

A.	Split the dataset into Training, Cross-validation and Testing datasets.

B.	Train and test 3 classifiers, each using one of the following techniques:

      •	Neural Network
      •	Support Vector Machine
      •	Logistic Regression
      
### Implementation:

This project has been implemented using Jupyter Notebooks equiped with various python libraries which include:

      •	Numpy
      •	Pandas
      •	SKLearn
      •	Pickle
